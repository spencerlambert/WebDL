WebDL
=====

WebDL (Web Data Link) - Work with disparate data sources, like API's, Databases, and Files, as if they were one source.

Along with a framework that allows for unified access to many types of data, this project has tools to quickly implement a web interface for accessing the data, building single forms that include data from multiple sources, joining multiple databases as if they were one.
